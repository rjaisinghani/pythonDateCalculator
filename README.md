# pythonDateCalculator
This program calculates the numbers of days between two given dates. The condition is that we are following the Gregorian calendar and that the first date is before the second date. 
My goals with this program are to implement a way to count days going backwards on the gregorian calander, and to add a loop to the main. The loop will ask the user if they want to check another date. If they say yes, the function is repeated with new inputs. If the user says no, the loop will break and end the program.
